        <h2><b>Child Birth Issue</b></h2><br>
            <i>
            	 <p class="pother">In a traditional society like India, birth of a child has always been a priority after  marriage. There was a time, when if a woman is not able to conceive immediately after marriage, her in-laws would curse her for not giving an heir to the family. But things have changed with time. Now, educated people prefer to consult a doctor and go through a medical examination to find out if there are any medical reasons for not having being able to conceive. There are cases where the doctors provide reassurance to the couple to stop worrying as there is nothing wrong with them biologically/medically, but still the couple is not able to conceive. This is when astrology comes to the aid of such couples.</p>

            <p class="pother">The horoscope of both the partners should be analysed for couples facing problems in childbirth. The presence of pitr dosha relating to childbirth causes delays and even after medical treatment, the result is negative. Astrology is a super science and medical science has its basis on this great science.</p>
