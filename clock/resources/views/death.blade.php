            <p class="pother">Karinaal are inauspicious Nakshatras among the 27 Nakshatrams. Another school of thought states that Karinal is based on days in a Tamil and Malayalam month. It is believed that death taking place on Karinaal is highly inauspicious. These days are avoided for certain auspicious functions. Karinaal is only followed in South India, especially in Tamil Nadu and Kerala by certain communities.</p>

<p class="pother">Commonly held belief is that if the Pariharas are not done, more deaths would follow.</p>
<p class="pother">
If one dies on these specified days, Parihara, Atonement is recommended.</p>
