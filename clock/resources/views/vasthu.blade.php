            <i><p class="pother"></p>
            <p class="pother">Vasthu is not a myth or a superstition as many in the modern world would like to believe. Vasthu is a science developed centuries ago for designing buildings like palaces or modest homes and work places. The ancient epic ‘The Mahabharatha’ also refers to Lord Vishwakarma and his science of architecture in the construction of the Lakshagraha (Wax Palace). Vasthu provides the basics of construction especially in harnessing the energies of nature for the betterment of home and society.</p>

            <p class="pother">Vastu Shastra is based on the concept of scientifically combining the five basic elements – earth, water, fire, air and sky – to create a pleasant setting. Vasthu principles integrated with architecture boost health, wealth, energy and prosperity and make the living or working atmosphere serene and enlightened.</p>
