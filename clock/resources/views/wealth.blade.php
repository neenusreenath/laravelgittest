        <h2><b>Wealth Problems</b></h2><br>
            <i><p class="pother">Money is not everything; but yet its importance cannot be denied mere its being secondary to many other important aspects of our life.</p>
            <p class="pother">Financial solvency is also one of the major ways to judge success and potential of our personality. On a broader note, there are two types of finance or wealth; one is inherited and the other is accommodated.</p>

            <p class="pother">In both cases, one has to be very alert, careful and studious enough to maintain and/or generate required finance or money for fulfillment of basic necessities of life. It is not just your profession or business; the financial problems do cast significant influence on your personality, health, relationships and performance. A person, who is not being rewarded for his efforts and fails to solve financial problems, may suffer from depression, disturbed relationships and may even get addicted to vices. Vedic astrology readings of your horoscope are quite helpful in this regard.</p>
